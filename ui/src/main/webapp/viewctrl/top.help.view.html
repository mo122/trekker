    Tasks follow <strong>treks</strong>. Treks are made up of steps. The steps
    have logical ordering so that we can quickly reason about trek progress.

  <p>
    For maximum actionability all tasks follow exactly one trek. Tasks may jump
    treks where it is convenient to co-opt them, e.g. a question reveals a subtle bug
    and changes from the question trek to the bug trek.

  <p>
    The following treks are defined.

  <dl>
    <dt ng-repeat-start="trek in vm.treks">
      {{ trek.name }}
    <dd ng-repeat="step in trek.steps" ng-repeat-end>
      {{ step }}
  </dl>

  <p>
    Tasks can be flagged. Flags impart upon a task some notion which supersedes the trek,
    but we still keep the trek to lead that task to its conclusion.

  <p>
    Only a single flag may be present on a task. Additional flags may be informative but
    become noisy with respect to task tracking. That goal of Trekker is to
    clarify tracking tasks, not to maintain meticulous task tracking metadata.
    I have found that data encoded in the form of structured flags
    usually feed some quasi-OCD tendency and rarely contribute the primary goal of a task
    tracking system: To get <em>lots of</em> things done.

  <p>
    The following flags are defined.

  <dl>
    <dt ng-repeat-start="flag in vm.flags">
      {{ flag.name }}
    <dd ng-repeat-end>{{ flag.description }}

  </dl>

  <p>
    Finally, tasks may be related to a particular heroic effort, which I have chosen to call
    an <strong>Odyssey</strong>.

  <p>
    These benefit us by grouping related tasks together, which
    when constituent tasks are completed, celebrates a significant achievement. If a
    <em>milestone</em> is the completion of a bundle of tasks within a time boundary,
    then odysseys are a bundle of goals within a semantic boundary, such as a complex feature,
    or a concerted effort to pay off a bundle of operational debts.
